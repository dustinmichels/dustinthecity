Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I am Dustin.

I am a software engineer, bike commuter, and believer in better cities.

I want to be part of the fight to make our cities more equitable, sustainable, beautiful, safe, and fun. This website is essentially a diary of my urban planning thoughts, observations, projects, and learnings.

Recent content is centered around my current location: Somerville, MA.
