When my friend Jonah visited me this week, I took him on a small but mighty bike tour. We rode-- almost entirely on protected bike paths-- down the Somerville Community Path, past North Point Park, through the North End to Long Wharf, around The Boston Common, and along the Charles River.

Perfect weather. So beautiful, easy and, most importantly, _safe_. The whole time we flew past dispirited drivers trapped in traffic.

I am so grateful to have friends that love bikes and biking, since I feel so strongly it is the most joyous way to navigate the city.

I grateful, too, for all the work that has gone into building dedicated bike infrastructure here. The trickiest part of the route is the North Washington Bridge, which is [already undergoing pedestrianization](https://www.boston.gov/departments/public-works/north-washington-street-bridge)!

Unfortunately, some of these paths are shared between pedestrians and cyclists, which make them unideal for commuting. They get too crowded during peak traffic, slowing bike traffic to a crawl and even then creating unnecessary stress and danger for pedestrians. The gold standard is to have separate, dedicated lanes for pedestrians and cyclists. However, with the existing infrastructure it is at least possible for, say, a child to navigate a huge swath of territory without ever riding alongside cars, which is a tremendous boon to the community.
