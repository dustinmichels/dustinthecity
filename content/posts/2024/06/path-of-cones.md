While commuting down Washington Street this morning, I encountered an Eversource electrical truck occupying the bike lane. Though this appeared to be a reasonable and unavoidable road blockage, I still murmured something under my breath about how _there is always shit in the bike lane_ and glanced over my left shoulder, preparing to merge into bustling traffic.

Then, I realized the workers had created a path of cones, preserving the lost bike lane and sidewalk while closing down one lane to car traffic. Unprecedented! Remarkable!

I looped back to snap a picture and shouted to a worker who was eyeing me that I was very grateful and felt so loved. He shouted back, "I'll set it up for you tomorrow, too!" [[See tweet.]](https://twitter.com/Dustin_Michels/status/1800918461406687623). What a rare delight.

## Contentious curbs

In the city, blocked bike lanes are a daily nuisance for cyclists. Delivery trucks, moving trucks, and service vehicles all wind up sitting in the bike lane with their blinkers on. Then you have parents, taxi drivers, and take-out aficionados conducting pick-ups and drop-offs.

In a famous (now 13-year-old) [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/bzE-IMaegzQ?si=j2KlrvYaWEZHpykD), Casey Neistat responds to the absurdity of being ticketed for _not_ riding in the bike lane in NYC by attempting to follow the law; he proceeds to crash his bike (with great commitment) into a non-stop barrage of obstacles, including a cop car.

Can anything be done?

For me, some obstructions feel reasonable. Other times I feel a driver is just being lazy. _Dude, there's a parking spot right there!_ However, the cumulative effect of being repeatedly ejected from what was ostensibly a dedicated bike lane and thrust into oncoming traffic is to feel stressed out, denigrated, and left to wonder, "Isn't there a better way?"
