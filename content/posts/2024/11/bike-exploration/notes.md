Meanwhile, what's happening with kids specifically? Oh, nothing much.. Damn.

Meanwhile, what's happening with parents? According to [Pew research](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/01/24/parenting-in-america-today/), "most parents (62%) say being a parent has been at least somewhat harder than they expected, with about a quarter (26%) saying itâ€™s been a lot harder."

The report also includes some recommendations for parents and caregivers, including:

- "Model healthy social connection, including constructive conflict resolution"
- "Help children and adolescents develop strong, safe, and stable relationships with supportive adults"
- "Encourage healthy social connection with peers"

The playground provides an excellent opportunity for children and adults alike to engage in-person social interaction, and for caregivers to accomplish all three of these objectives.
