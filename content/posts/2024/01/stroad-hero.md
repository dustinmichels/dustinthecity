While in Muncie, Indiana, I stayed with my partner at a hotel that was decidedly difficult to reach by foot. We joked about scurrying across the "stroad" to get there.

"Stroad" is a derogatory term I learned from a "Not just bikes" [youtube video](https://youtu.be/ORzNZUeUHAM?si=UFjHQrRxeFrD4NAe).
