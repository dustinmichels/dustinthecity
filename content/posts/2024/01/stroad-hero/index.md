While my partner and I were attending to family matters in Muncie, Indiana, we stayed in a hotel that was decidedly difficult to reach by foot.

The hotel was embedded within a sprawling shopping area that stretched along a major roadway. All the staples of American suburban consumerism were present: Walmart, Walgreens, Lowes, BestBuy, PetSmart, Taco Bell, Panda Express, and so on. The major artery was a state road with 4-6 lanes of traffic, but even after you cross that, you still have to navigate a dismal web of massive parking lots and corpulent side roads. Sometimes, you find a sidewalk, but it usually doesn’t lead anywhere. Sometimes, you come to a fence and have to find a new way around.

This type of area is built for cars, not people. If you have the audacity to travel by foot, you will find the experience confusing, tedious, and sometimes dangerous.

As we lamented all the "stroads" you have to dart across to reach your destination, I began envisioning a Frogger-esque video game called "Stroad Hero."

## What is a stroad?

"Stroad" is a term I learned from a [NotJustBikes YouTube video](https://youtu.be/ORzNZUeUHAM?si=UFjHQrRxeFrD4NAe) to describe an abundant and unholy type of thoroughfare-- a road/street hybrid that disastrously muddles the design principles of each.

The idea is that traffic planners (especially in countries like the Netherlands) often clearly distinguish between a road and a street.

- **A road** is expressly for moving cars quickly and safely _between_ destinations. To accommodate the high speeds, lanes should be wide and forgiving, the curves gradual or even banked, and the margins clear of deadly obstacles like big trees. You want to minimize stopping. In the case of a highway, you have onramps and offramps instead of intersections.

- **A street** is for moving cars, bikes, and people around once you _reach_ a destination, like a neighborhood or a city center. Here, cars are constantly slowing down to turn or park and to yield to pedestrians, so speeds need to drop.

However, what you find all over America is the “stroad.” It has many features of a road, like wide, straight lanes for moving cars along as fast as possible. But it is _also_ a destination where drivers constantly need to slow, turn, park, and get out of their cars.

Everything about the design indicates you should be able to drive really fast, but you can’t. You must be on the lookout for turning cars and intersections.

Stroads are full of these annoying contradictions and ironic oddities. For example, you might see a wide margin devoid of trees or any obstacles a car could collide with (as dictated by road design principles), but then a bike lane or sidewalk is haphazardly tossed into that same margin!

The NotJustBikes video also states that these places can feel unsettling to traverse on foot since they are built to highway scale, not human scale. You encounter the looming jumbo signs needed to attract the attention of a fast-moving motorist, which feel uncanny once you step outside the car.

This was definitely the case in that Muncie shopping area.

## Stroad Hero

### Concept

The initial idea was to create a simple, 2D, pixel-art-based ode to Frogger, where you try to cross a stroad without getting smushed. It would be an activist game about street safety. As I chatted with friends, more narrative elements quickly evolved.

I decided you should play as Mats, a hapless Dutch boy trying to navigate a perilous shopping center in Anywhere, USA. I thought the tagline could be: “Do you have what it takes to complete a series of simple shopping tasks without becoming another senseless pedestrian death? Do you have what it takes to become the Stroad Hero?”

I imagined that Mats and his mother had recently moved to the US from the Netherlands, where children can more safely get around and complete basic tasks with autonomy. Each day, his mother gives him a list of errands to complete. They are both unaware of how challenging this will be.

I envisioned an “SPD” counter in the top right corner (for senseless pedestrian deaths), which increases each time Mats gets crushed. And an “errands completed” counter, too.

In addition to revulsion at little Mats getting crushed repeatedly, I also hoped to create a sense of frustration at wandering through a sprawling and confusing area. I wanted there to be some humor, too, in parodying this ridiculous environment. I imagined spoofing all the shops' names and logos, like “TacoHell” and “WalGroins.”

And it should be fun, too. I thought the fun could come from becoming the Stroad Hero-- from achieving mastery over this daunting environment. Not only does the player learn to move without getting hit, but she could also unlock new tools to make movement easier. Like a skateboard or a hammer she could wave at motorists to make them stop.

But is that the right message? That you can “win” by mastering this environment? In an alternative concept, there are other pedestrians besides you getting killed, and their deaths also augment the SPD counter. No matter how trained your own movement becomes, you still lose. The only way to win is to change the built environment. Perhaps you can sneak out at night to paint crosswalks where they are lacking. Or somehow lobby the city council to redo the street?? Via a fun mini game??
