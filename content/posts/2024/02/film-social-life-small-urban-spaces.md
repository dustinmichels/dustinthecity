My friend [Nicholas Russo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-russo-19921221b/) has been doing remarkable things in Pittsfield, MA. He's been an incredibly effective bike advocate, and I have had the privilege of watching him create the Pittsfield Community Design Center (https://www.pittsfieldcommunity.design/) piece by piece â€”a beautiful community space for learning, envisioning, and organizing "to build more connected, authentic, neighborly, and strong communities around the city."

This week, they hosted a documentary screening of "The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces." (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1778327/)
