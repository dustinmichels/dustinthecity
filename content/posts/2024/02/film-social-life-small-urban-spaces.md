My friend [Nicholas Russo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-russo-19921221b/) has been doing remarkable things in Pittsfield, MA as a community organizer, transportation planner, and bike advocate. I have had the privilege of watching him create the [Pittsfield Community Design Center](https://www.pittsfieldcommunity.design/) piece by piece â€”a community space for learning, envisioning, and organizing "to build more connected, authentic, neighborly, and strong communities around the city."

This week, they hosted a documentary screening of "[The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1778327/)."
