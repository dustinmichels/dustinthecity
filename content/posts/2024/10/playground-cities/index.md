While having dinner with friends, I got excited about the idea of playgrounds as little microcosms of cities, in which the "[affordances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance)" of the built environment heavily influence the types of activity that take place. When designing playgrounds, as with designing cities, we must think carefully about how to create spaces that encourage and facilitate desirable interactions.

For example, let's talk about swings.

A "classic" swing is good for a parent to push a young child, promoting parent-child bonding.

If this were an explicit goal, one could even install a ["generation swing"](https://leaparkandplay.com/product/generation-swing) that lets a parent and child swing face-to-face.

Slightly older children might engage in jumping competitions, or challenge each other to swing as high as possible during recess, honing physical aptitudes while socializing.

Even older children might swing besides one another while chatting, once again using the space to deepen a pair bond. A swing set could be a suitable place for youth to engage in challenging conversations or grow a budding romance. Why? The swing set lets you converse with a partner, in a neutral, public space, where the distraction of swinging and the lack of eye contact lessen the intensity of the conversation making it easier to broach awkward topics.

These are all powerful interactions facilitated by a simple swing set. But is the swing set a good space for meeting strangers? Not particularly. What if we want children and parents and turn outwards, forming new bonds with others in the playground community?

A large basket swing carries an entirely new set of social norms and possibilities.

Many children can pile onto the basket, sitting and standing, and share an experience of swinging together. This encourages kids to interact with each other, and potentially, an adult to interact with kids that aren't their own via pushing.

Here's a picture from [Imece Initiative](https://www.imeceinitiative.com/en/) in Turkey, when I did volunteer work with Syrian kids, and where at basket swing was an endlessly entertaining focal point of play:

A basket swing is a great use of real-estate and capital, since the footprint is only marginally larger than a classic swing but many children can use it at once. But the question of which swing to install is also a philosophical question about the purpose of the playground.

_Is this a place for parents to play with their own children? Or a place for multiple children to meet each other through play together, while parents must cooperate and trust each other with the important jobs like pushing the swing?_

Personally, when it comes to playgrounds and cities alike, I am especially interested in infrastructure that encourages strangers to meet and form bonds, since many Americans and in particular parents and children seem to be suffering from afflictions tied to social isolation.

The US is a land where insular, nuclear families are the default, and where paranoia about 'stranger danger' runs high, yet parents frequently complain about the loneliness and difficulty of raising children without "a village." Meanwhile children face rising rates of anxiety and clinical depression, amounting to [a national emergency](https://www.npr.org/2021/10/20/1047624943/pediatricians-call-mental-health-crisis-among-kids-a-national-emergency).

Much has been written about the loneliness epidemic in the US. This is not just a slogan; in May 2023, Dr. Vivek Murthy released [a Surgeon General Advisory](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/03/new-surgeon-general-advisory-raises-alarm-about-devastating-impact-epidemic-loneliness-isolation-united-states.html) warning of a crisis of loneliness, isolation, and lack of connection in this country, entailing many public health risks to individuals and communities. The report states that "lacking connection can increase the risk for premature death to levels comparable to smoking daily."[^1]

The warning cites a steep decline in-person interactions, accelerated by the covid-19 pandemic, as one culprit, and specifically recommends strengthening "social infrastructure", including parks and libraries as a solution.

The report also includes some recommendations specifically for parents and caregivers:

- "Model healthy social connection, including constructive conflict resolution"
- "Help children and adolescents develop strong, safe, and stable relationships with supportive adults"
- "Encourage healthy social connection with peers"

The playground provides an excellent opportunity for children and adults alike to engage in-person social interaction, and for caregivers to accomplish all three of these objectives.

But what happens when you get to the playground? Do parents sit on their phones while children play independently? Do parents play one-on-one with their own children? Or do parents and children play together, forming new bonds that may even extend beyond the playground? There is a place for all of these, but the last one seems the most elusive unless careful thought is put into the design of the playground.

The basket swing is one technology I see that invites play beyond established pairs.

At a park I frequently visit with my "little" from the [Big Brother Big Sister](https://www.bbbs.org/) program, I see another. There's a giant carousel that children can climb on which spins in circles, but it's heavy enough that a young child struggles to push it alone. This invites children to work together or enlist the help of an adult-- any adult.

In playgrounds, cooperative, community-building play can be encouraged by design. You can almost trick kids and caregivers into _having_ to meet each other in order to maximize the toys at their disposal.

What is the corollary for cities?
