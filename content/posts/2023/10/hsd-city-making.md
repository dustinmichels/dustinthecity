On Tuesday evening, I attended a talk at Harvard School of Design (HSD) delivered by Manuel Salgado, an architect and former head of urban planning on the Lisbon City Council. The topic was "city-making" and "how to intervene as a contemporary architect working in a historical city?"

I enjoyed hearing about Salgado's long and winding career, and his reluctant pivot from architect into public servant, when a seat opened up on the Lisbon City Council and he was encouraged to run.

**Notes:**

“New heritage”

Remove cars— sewage system

“Gentrification is the result of globalization”

Relationship with other cities, private car ownership

Regret from revitalized area, lost opportunity to buy cheap housing and maintain as affordable housing

How to balance tourism and affordable housing

7.5 meter motif, allowing team to build all together
