In a household budget, art is more of a luxury than a necessity. You need to pay rent and utilities and put food on the table first, and then, if there is room left over, maybe you can think about beatification and art.

When it comes to community development it is not so. Art is a necessity from the start. Beautiful places are worthy of attention and investment, while ugly places are not.

When wondering why one small towns fosters a lively downtown while a neighboring town contains only an abandoned strip mall, consider the presence of art and artists.

Artists often act as pioneer species. In ecology, pioneer species appear first in harsh conditions. Not only are they able to survive, they improve the quality of the soil and a greater variety of plants eventually follow. Artists sometimes do exactly the same for the lifeless, abandoned communities they enter and transform.
